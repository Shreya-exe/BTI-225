        <h3>Student Introduction</h3>
        <br>
        <p>My name is Shreya, and I am currently studying at Seneca College in the BSD program, which stands for Bachelor
            of Technology - Software Development. I am originally from India. I aim to become a web developer specializing
            in back-end development once I complete my course. While I am strongly interested in the foundation aspect of
            web development, I am particularly drawn to the challenges and intricacies of back-end development. Seneca
            College offers a comprehensive program that equips students with the necessary skills and knowledge in software
            development. I appreciate your understanding. Few more info about seneca is presented bellow; </p>
