        <h3>Introduction to HTML5</h3>

       
        <p>This site utilizes HTML5, the latest version of a markup language used to structure and present content on the
            internet. HTML5 provides enhanced features and capabilities to create modern and interactive web pages. It's
            an essential technology that forms the foundation of most websites and web applications we use daily. The World
            Wide Web Consortium (W3C) developed HTML5, and it became an official standard in October 2014.</p>
